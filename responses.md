**Input**: ``generate 5 mcqs on python basics in hard difficulty``

**Output**:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Explain the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python, providing examples where each is appropriate and illustrating potential pitfalls of using one over the other when dealing with nested mutable objects.",
      "answer": "A shallow copy creates a new object, but it populates it with references to the elements of the original object.  A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the object and all its nested objects.  Shallow copies are faster but can lead to unexpected behavior when modifying nested mutable objects because changes in the copy affect the original and vice-versa. Deep copies are safer for nested mutable objects but consume more memory and are slower.  Example:  Shallow copy of a list of lists will create a new list, but the inner lists remain shared. Modifying an inner list in the copy will affect the original. A deep copy would create independent copies of all inner lists.",
      "explanation": "The correct answer highlights the key difference and the implications for mutable objects.  Incorrect options misrepresent the speed and applicability of each copy method.",
      "options": [
        "Shallow copy copies only the references, deep copy copies the values.",
        "Shallow copy is faster and always preferred.",
        "Deep copy is slower and only necessary for immutable objects.",
        "Shallow copy and deep copy are functionally identical."
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe a scenario where using a generator function in Python would significantly improve performance compared to a regular function returning a list.  Illustrate your answer with code examples.",
      "answer": "Generator functions are more memory-efficient when dealing with large datasets because they yield one item at a time instead of creating a whole list in memory.  For example, processing a huge log file line by line. A regular function would load the entire file into memory. A generator function would yield each line individually, processing it and discarding it before moving on to the next. This is crucial when dealing with data that exceeds available RAM.",
      "explanation": "The correct option emphasizes memory efficiency, the primary advantage of generators for large data.  Incorrect options misrepresent the speed and applicability of generators.",
      "options": [
        "Generator functions are always faster than regular functions.",
        "Generator functions are only useful for small datasets.",
        "Generator functions and regular functions have identical performance for large datasets.",
        "Generator functions are more memory-efficient for large datasets."
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of decorators in Python and provide a practical example demonstrating their use for logging function execution time.  Discuss the use of *args and **kwargs for flexible decorator application.",
      "answer": "Decorators are a powerful and expressive feature in Python that allows you to modify or enhance functions and methods in a clean and readable way without modifying their core implementation. They achieve this using nested functions and closures.  The example would involve a decorator function that takes a function as input, wraps it, and times its execution using `time.perf_counter()`.  *args and **kwargs allow the decorator to work with functions that accept any number of positional or keyword arguments.",
      "explanation": "The correct answer accurately describes decorators and their use.  Incorrect options misrepresent their capabilities and mechanisms.",
      "options": [
        "Decorators are only useful for simple functions.",
        "Decorators cannot handle functions with variable arguments.",
        "Decorators modify the original function's code directly.",
        "Decorators provide a way to add functionality to functions without modifying them."
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you effectively handle exceptions in Python to ensure robustness and graceful error handling in your programs, particularly when dealing with file I/O and network operations? Provide examples demonstrating `try-except-finally` blocks and context managers.",
      "answer": "Robust exception handling involves using `try-except-finally` blocks to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.  The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception.  The `except` block handles the exception if it occurs.  The `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred, allowing for cleanup actions like closing files or network connections. Context managers (`with` statement) simplify exception handling, especially for resources that need to be released (e.g., files).",
      "explanation": "The correct answer stresses the importance of specific exception handling and resource management using `try-except-finally` and context managers.  Incorrect options misrepresent best practices.",
      "options": [
        "Exceptions should always be ignored to prevent program crashes.",
        "`try-except` blocks are sufficient for all exception handling scenarios.",
        "`finally` blocks are optional and rarely needed.",
        "Effective exception handling requires specific exception types and resource cleanup."
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Discuss the differences between class methods, static methods, and instance methods in Python. Provide examples illustrating when each type of method is most appropriate.",
      "answer": "Instance methods operate on an instance of a class and have access to the instance's attributes (`self`). Class methods operate on the class itself and have access to the class attributes (`cls`). Static methods are utility functions related to the class but don't have access to instance or class attributes.  Appropriate use cases: instance methods for operations specific to an object, class methods for factory methods or class-level operations, and static methods for helper functions logically associated with the class.",
      "explanation": "The correct answer clearly differentiates the three method types and their appropriate applications.  Incorrect options misrepresent their functionality and usage.",
      "options": [
        "All three method types are functionally equivalent.",
        "Class methods are always faster than instance methods.",
        "Static methods are only used for mathematical calculations.",
        "The choice of method type depends on access to instance and class attributes."
